/**
 * MyComponent has a visibility property which is initialized to false. The render method returns one view if the value of visibility 
 * is true, and a different view if it is false.
Currently, there is no way of updating the visibility property in the component's state. The value should toggle back and forth between 
true and false. There is a click handler on the button which triggers a class method called toggleVisibility(). Define this method so 
the state of visibility toggles to the opposite value when the method is called. If visibility is false, the method sets it to true, 
and vice versa.
Finally, click the button to see the conditional rendering of the component based on its state.
Hint: Don't forget to bind the this keyword to the method in the constructor!
